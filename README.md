# Spindelnät

Spindelnät _(meaning spider web in Swedish)_ is a micro networking framework built on top of [URLRequest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlrequest). 
The purpose of the framework is to provide type safe abstractions using the builder pattern in order to create URLRequest structs.
